    """Implementation of a d-ary heap.
    The branching factor for the heap can be passed as an argument.
    It's 2 by default, which is also the minimum possible value.
    The branching factor is the maximum number of children that each internal node can have.
    For regular heaps, a node an have at most 2 children, so the branching factor is 2.
    The higher the branching factor, the shortest the height of the heap. However, when an element is
    pushed towards the leaves of the heap, at each step all children of current node must be examined,
    so a larger branching factor implies a higher number of nodes to be checked for each step of this
    operation.
    On the other hand, inserting elements only examines at most h element, where h is the height of the heap,
    so this operation is only made faster with larger branching factors.
    In general values between 3 and 5 are a good compromise and produce good performance."""
